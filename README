= w32evol -- x86 obfuscation engine

== Description
The Win32/Evol virus, which appeared around July 2000, implemented a 
metamorphic engine that was able to run on any major Win32 platform.  One of 
the functionalities of Evol's metamorphic engine was to insert garbage 
between core instructions.

== Installation
This engine was built in Windows XP using the MASM32 assembler (ml.exe).

A rakefile is included for convenience.  The engine does not need to be 
rebuilt.  The executable file, w32evol.exe is found in the bin directory.
The source code is in the src directory.

If you need to rebuild this engine, try to do so under Windows XP.  However, 
you may have luck in Linux using Wine.
